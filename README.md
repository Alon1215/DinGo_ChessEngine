# DinGo (chess engine)
Chess engine (following UCI protocol) fully implemented in Go (Golang).
Built as a part of [Tomer Gonen](https://github.com/yodatk)'s and my chess engines competition which will take place at 30.10.20 . 

The engine will be featuring state of the art search techniques (alpha-beta search, tranportation table) and is based on bitboards. Magic numbers for bitBoards will be used for move generation.

Future goals:
* Late move reduction
* Improve evaluation
* Implementing deep learning techniques
